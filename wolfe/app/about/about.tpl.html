							<center><p>Here at Wolfe Cycle we have a dedicated women’s section. Men and women are built differently, so their bikes need to be built to accommodate those differences. The differences are mostly seen in the frame’s geometry and the bikes contact points. These changes allow for superior power, increased handling and better balance. We offer a range of specific women’s Commuter, Hybrid and Racing Bicycles. We also stock cycling clothing, helmets and rain gear.</p></center>
