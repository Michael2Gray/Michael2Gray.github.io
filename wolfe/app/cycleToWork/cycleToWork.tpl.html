						<center><p>The Cycle to Work Scheme came into force in 2009 to encourage people to cycle to work.</p></center>
						<p>This tax break is very simple to use. There are a number of benefits to the individual and the firm. The main benefit to the cyclist from a tax point of view is that the employee does not pay income tax, PRSI or USC on any amount (up to €1000) spent on a bicycle and accessories when used for the purpose of travelling to work.</p>
						<p>We suggest that employees select a bike and accessories ideally after consulting with our sales staff that are experienced cyclists and will be able to advise you on what products best suit your needs. You can visit our shop on Sundrive Road. We will give a quote/invoice for the employer. The employee gives a statement to the employer stating that the bicycle is to be used mainly for cycling to work and agrees with the employer to the salary sacrifice arrangement instead of payment. This is the only statement Revenue requires the employer to have.</p>
